# agent-trace

A small local proxy that sits between your coding agent and the model
provider's API, and writes a **readable Markdown document for every request**:
the real system prompt, the tool definitions, and the messages your agent
sends to the model.

It works with Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Pi, OMP, Gemini
CLI, Antigravity CLI and Junie, and with any OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible
server through a custom base URL.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g github:jiroamato/agent-trace
```

The built output is checked in under `dist/`, so installing needs no build
step and no dev dependencies. To update, run the same command again.

To work on it from a clone instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiroamato/agent-trace.git
cd agent-trace
npm install
npm link
```

## Run it

```bash
agent-trace
```

The first time you run it, it asks which agent you use, then which model
provider you use with it. (OMP is the one exception: it has no fixed provider
of its own, so it skips straight to the base URL question below.) Last, it
asks whether to remember your answer. Say no if you swap agents often, and it
asks again every time. It then prints the exact command for your setup, and
starts listening.

It keeps listening until you stop it. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop it. The console
says so too.

Both questions end with **Other, or not sure**. Pick it if your setup is not in
the list, and the tool gives you a link to ask for it.

The provider question has a second way out, too: **Custom base URL**. Pick it
if your provider is not in the list but you know its base URL - a local model
server such as Ollama, or a smaller hosted provider such as DeepSeek, say. It
asks two questions instead of showing you a dead end:

- the base URL of the model server you want to log, for example
  `http://localhost:11434` for Ollama, or `https://api.deepseek.com` for
  DeepSeek; and
- which wire format it speaks - OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, or
  "not sure", if you do not know.

If you are not sure, pick "not sure". The tool still logs everything; it just
shows you the raw JSON instead of a fully readable render, because it cannot
safely guess a shape you did not tell it. See "What you get" below.

For **OpenCode** with an **OpenAI-compatible** custom target, and for **every**
**Pi** custom target, the wizard also tries the unauthenticated `/v1/models`
endpoint and offers any model IDs it finds. You can always enter an ID
manually, and the wizard falls back to manual entry if discovery fails.
Endpoints that require credentials for model listing are not supported.

- OpenCode's printed command uses a temporary `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`
  provider for that one run, merged with your existing OpenCode configuration
  without editing its file.
- Pi has no such temporary option, so the selected model is written into
  `~/.pi/agent/models.json` alongside the base URL, replacing that provider's
  built-in model list with the one you chose. Without this, Pi would keep
  offering its built-in model names (`gpt-4o`, and the like), which almost
  never exist on a custom server - the agent would start but every turn would
  fail.
- Pi asks for a model on every wire format, including Anthropic-compatible,
  but discovery itself only ever checks the OpenAI-style `/v1/models` listing
  endpoint, which an Anthropic-compatible server often does not expose. If
  discovery finds nothing there, that is expected, and typing the model ID by
  hand is the normal path, not a sign something is broken.

To change a remembered answer:

```bash
agent-trace --force
```

This forgets the old answer first, then keeps the new one in its place. It does
not ask whether to remember, because you already said yes once. If you pick an
agent that cannot be logged, nothing is kept, and the old answer is gone too.

To use a different port:

```bash
PORT=9000 agent-trace
```

On Windows, run that in PowerShell (not Command Prompt) as:

```powershell
$env:PORT = 9000; agent-trace
```

## Where things are kept

Everything the tool writes lives under one directory, `~/.agent-trace` by
default:

| Path                | Contents                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `logs/`             | One capture per request. See "What you get". |
| `agent-choice.json` | Your remembered answer, if you kept one.     |

Set `AGENT_TRACE_DIR` to put that directory somewhere else, for example to
keep one set of captures per project:

```bash
AGENT_TRACE_DIR=./traces agent-trace
```

Captures hold your prompts and your code. If you point the directory into a
project tree, gitignore it.

The remembered answer holds your choice only. The host, the renderer and the
command are worked out again on every start, so an update to this tool reaches
you without you having to clear anything.

The one exception is a **Custom base URL** answer. There is no catalogue entry
for it to be worked out from - you typed it - so the base URL and the wire
format you chose are saved in the file too, alongside your choice. OpenCode's
OpenAI-compatible custom route, and every Pi custom route, also save the
selected model ID, so a remembered choice starts without repeating discovery.
Everything else about a custom answer still behaves the same way: change it
any time with `--force`, and it is never kept for an agent that cannot be
logged.

## The agents

The tool prints the correct command for you, so you do not have to copy anything
from this table. It is here so you can see what is supported before you start.

| Agent           | Works | What you need                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code     | Yes   | One command. Works with a subscription login, an Anthropic API key, or Google Vertex AI. |
| Codex           | Yes   | One flag. A subscription or an API key works.                                            |
| GitHub Copilot  | Yes   | Your normal subscription login.                                                          |
| OpenCode        | Yes   | One command, or a config file.                                                           |
| Pi              | Yes   | A config file. Pi has no base URL variable.                                              |
| OMP             | Yes   | A YAML config file. Point it at any backend.                                             |
| Gemini CLI      | Yes   | One command. The free Google login works.                                                |
| Antigravity CLI | Yes   | A config file and a real Gemini API key - see below.                                     |
| Junie           | Yes   | A config file, and a real API key pasted in - see below.                                 |
| Cursor CLI      | No    | Nothing can make it work. See below.                                                     |
| Amp             | No    | Nothing can make it work. See below.                                                     |

Any other provider - a local model server, or a smaller hosted one - works
through **Custom base URL**, above, on any agent in this table except Cursor
and Amp.

### Claude Code on Google Vertex AI

If your Claude Code already talks to Vertex AI (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1` is
set), pick **Google Vertex AI** at the provider question instead of
**Anthropic**. Vertex mode reads a different variable for a base-URL
override, `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL` rather than `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
because `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` belongs to the direct-API code path and is
silently ignored once Vertex mode is on. Picking **Anthropic** here while
`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1` is set is the most common way a Vertex user's logs
folder stays empty with no error at all.

This route only covers `CLOUD_ML_REGION=global`, the default and most common
setting. A regional value (`us-east5`, say) talks to a different host and
is not wired up yet. Ask for it via the issue tracker if you hit this.

### Antigravity CLI

Antigravity CLI (`agy`) is a separate Google product from Gemini CLI, a
different binary and a different agent harness, not a rebrand of it. Its
API-key route, though, stores its settings under Gemini CLI's own directory
(`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`) and calls the public Gemini API
directly, reading the exact same `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` variable Gemini
CLI's own API-key route reads. That means the existing `gemini` renderer
already reads this capture correctly. No new wire format was needed, only a
catalogue entry.

Two things must both be true before Antigravity CLI takes this route at all,
rather than falling back to its own account sign-in:

- `modelProvider` is `"gemini"` in the settings file the wizard writes for you, and
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is exported in your shell. This tool does not set it, the
  same way it does not set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude Code's own API-key
  route.

Only this API-key route is covered. Antigravity CLI's default account
sign-in was not verified. Antigravity CLI is closed source, and public
reporting on the related Antigravity IDE suggests its account-login traffic
can go to a different, internal host rather than the Code Assist host Gemini
CLI's own free login uses. Ask for it via the issue tracker if you need it
logged.

### Junie

Junie is BYOK across several backends, with no fixed host of its own, the
same shape as OMP, so it goes through the base URL and wire format
questions like a custom target does, picking a real Anthropic-compatible or
OpenAI-compatible template depending which you choose. It writes a proxy
entry to `~/.junie/config.json` (user scope; a project-scope file at
`<project-root>/.junie/config.json` takes precedence if you have one, see
Junie's own docs), merged in alongside whatever else is already there.

Junie is the one agent here with no existing login for this tool to pass
through. Its custom-proxy mechanism bypasses JetBrains AI authentication
entirely, so the printed config carries a placeholder header line and you
paste in a real API key yourself: an Anthropic key on the
Anthropic-compatible route, an OpenAI key on the OpenAI-compatible one.
Treat that file the way you would any other file holding a real key: do not
commit it.

### Why Cursor and Amp cannot work

Some vendors build the system prompt **on your machine** and send it to the
model. You can read that, because it goes past your network card.

Some vendors build the system prompt **on their servers**. Your machine sends
your message and very little else. The prompt and the tool list are added after
your request arrives at their server.

Cursor and Amp are the second kind. Search the whole shipped Cursor bundle and
you will find no system prompt text and no tool schemas at all. No proxy can
read what your machine never sends. This is not a limit of this tool. It is a
property of the product.

## The Observer Effect

Watching a thing can change the thing.

Claude Code trusts exactly one host. When you point it somewhere else, it turns
off tool search. That means it stops deferring tools and writes every tool
schema into the request instead. Your capture is then bigger than a real one and
has a different shape. That is the opposite of what you want from a tool whose
whole job is to show you the truth.

The command this tool prints for you sets `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true`, which turns
the effect off.

Measured through this tool with the same prompt:

| Run                            | Capture size |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Base URL only                  | 63,596 bytes |
| With `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` | 39,013 bytes |

That is 39% smaller, and the tool-search tool appears only in the second
capture.

## What you get

Every request writes three files to the `logs/` directory. They share a base
name such as `2026-07-07T14-32-05-123_claude-code`:

| File            | Contents                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `.md`           | The readable render. Start here.         |
| `.request.txt`  | The request body exactly as it was sent. |
| `.response.txt` | The raw response stream.                 |

The `.md` file uses **XML tags** (`<request>`, `<system-prompt>`, `<tools>`,
`<messages>`, `<response>`) to mark its sections, because the captured content is
full of its own Markdown headings. It is complete and not truncated, so it is a
trustworthy readout of what the model received.

If you picked "not sure" for a custom base URL's wire format, the `.md` file
holds pretty-printed JSON instead of that fully tagged render. There is no
system prompt or tool section, because the tool was not told the shape needed
to find them. Nothing is lost: it is still the whole request and response, just
less readable. Run with `--force` and pick the real wire format once you know
it, and the tagged render takes over from the next request.

Secret headers (`authorization`, `x-api-key`, `api-key`) are hidden in the `.md`
file and are never written to the `.txt` files.

Some agents compress the request body. The `.md` file shows the decoded body so
that you can read it. The `.request.txt` file keeps the bytes exactly as they
were sent, so you can still replay it.

## How it works

- One process, one port, **one upstream host**. Your choice decides where
  requests go and how they are read. The tool does not guess from the URL,
  because several agents share the same URLs and guessing gets them wrong.
- Your real auth header passes through untouched, so your requests authenticate
  normally. The tool only reads a copy on the way past.
- Responses are **streamed straight back** as they arrive, so your agent behaves
  exactly as it would without the tool.

### One message is not one request

A single message you send is often **not** a single API request. A typical
Claude Code turn fans out into:

- **one** real generation call, which is the only one that produces a reply, and
  the one whose request holds the full system prompt and tools; and
- **many** token-counting calls, which are housekeeping. They measure sizes for
  the context bar, for caching and for compaction, and they return a number
  rather than model output.

Housekeeping calls carry no model output, so the tool **forwards them but does
not log them**. Your logs folder therefore holds real turns only. You still see a
`(housekeeping, not logged)` line in the console when they happen, so the fan-out
stays visible.

Different agents fan out differently, and that is worth watching:

- **OpenCode** never counts tokens. Instead it makes a second call with a small
  model to title the thread, so one turn writes exactly two captures.
- **Pi** never counts tokens at all, so every file is a real turn.
- **Gemini** on the free Google login makes several extra calls that carry no
  prompt. Those are not logged either.

### If your logs folder fills up in seconds

Some agents retry a failing call immediately and with no backoff. If the
call keeps failing the same way (a wrong base URL scheme, a bad model ID,
bad credentials) that turns into a tight loop of real requests, each one a
genuine POST the tool would otherwise write a full capture for. Left
unchecked, that is thousands of near-identical files in a few seconds.

Once the same method, path and status code repeats more than 20 times inside
2 seconds, this tool stops writing a capture for every repeat. It still
forwards every one of them untouched, so your agent is not affected; it just
stops filling your disk and your terminal with duplicates. You get one loud
warning naming the call and the likely causes, then a single summary line
every 500 repeats for as long as the loop continues.

The fix is always upstream of this tool: stop the agent, fix the base URL,
model ID or credentials, and start again. `omp` hitting `http://` instead of
`https://` on a provider's real API is the case this was built for. The
plaintext request gets rejected in milliseconds with no retry guidance in the
response, and some agents read that as "retry", not "give up."

## If your logs folder stays empty

The failure modes here are quiet ones. An empty folder looks the same whichever
of these happened:

1. **You changed agent and forgot to say so.** Run `agent-trace --force`. The
   line at the top of the console names the agent the tool currently thinks
   you use.
2. **Your agent chose a WebSocket.** This tool reads HTTP. Some Copilot models,
   and Pi's default transport, negotiate a WebSocket instead, and a WebSocket
   turn writes no log at all. The printed command sets the right transport where
   it can.
3. **You are signed in a way that goes around the tool.** A ChatGPT sign-in on
   OpenCode talks to a different host on purpose. Use an API key for that one.
   Codex is different: pick the ChatGPT route in the wizard and it works.
4. **You started your agent before setting the variable.** Agents read the
   variable once, at startup.
5. **You are on an older Codex, or following an older guide.** Codex used to
   read an OPENAI_BASE_URL variable. Version 0.133.0 does not. It ignores the
   variable in silence, so the only sign is an empty logs folder. Use the
   command this tool prints.

## How much this was tested

- **Claude Code on the direct Anthropic API, and OMP, are tested end to end.**
  The measurements above are real.
- **The others were verified** by reading the published code of each agent and
  by driving them against a local listener. Claude Code on Google Vertex AI is
  in this group, verified against Anthropic's own Vertex documentation, not
  yet driven against a real Vertex project.
- **Junie is the least-verified entry in the catalogue.** Junie CLI is
  closed source, so unlike every other agent here its entry was not checked
  against real source, only against JetBrains' published Junie CLI docs
  (`config.json`, custom proxies, and CLI reference). It has not been driven
  against a real Junie install. If the proxy `kind`, the config file's
  precise shape, or the header format is wrong, that is the likely reason,
  and the fix is one line in `agents.ts`.
- **Antigravity CLI is verified against published docs only, the same way
  Junie is.** Its API-key route was checked against Google's own Antigravity
  CLI documentation, not against real source or a real install, and its
  account sign-in route was not verified at all.
- **A custom base URL is only as tested as the agent it is attached to.** The
  base URL and wire format mechanism itself is tested directly (see
  `agents.test.ts`); a specific third-party server behind it has not
  necessarily been driven end to end.
- **Windows:** the built CLI is run end to end on Windows with Claude Code's
  Anthropic route (PowerShell command, capture written, secrets redacted).
  WSL and Git Bash need no special handling; they are POSIX shells, so they
  use the same command as Mac and Linux. Native PowerShell gets its own
  `$env:NAME = 'value'` syntax instead (see `withEnv` in `agents.ts`).
  Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) is not supported; use PowerShell.

If one of them is wrong, it is worth reporting, and the fix is likely to be one
line in `agents.ts`.

## Developing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # run from source without building
npm test           # vitest
npm run typecheck
npm run format
npm run build      # refresh dist/ - commit it with your change
```

`dist/` is committed so that `npm install -g github:...` works without a
build step. CI fails if it is out of date with `src/`.

Two tests exec a real POSIX shell to prove the printed command's quoting
survives it. They are skipped on native Windows.

### Extending it

- **Add an agent:** add one entry to the catalogue in `src/agents.ts`, giving
  its upstream host, its renderer, its base URL suffix, and its command. That
  is the whole job. The wizard, the banner and the routing all read from
  there, so nothing else needs to change.
- **Add an agent with no fixed upstream at all**, the way OMP has none: give it
  no upstream host, set `alwaysCustom: true`, and give its one provider entry a
  bin and a setup file. The wizard then skips the provider question for it
  entirely and asks the two custom-base-url questions directly. See the OMP
  entry in `src/agents.ts` for the whole shape.
- **Add a wire format:** add a renderer in `src/render.ts` and name it on the
  catalogue entry. Unknown shapes already fall back to pretty-printed JSON, so
  you can iterate safely.
- **Watch the base URL suffix.** It is per-agent on purpose and never a global
  rule. Some agents append the whole path to what you give them and so must not
  have a `/v1`. Some append only the last part and so must have one. Getting it
  wrong produces a 404 that is hard to read. There is a test for each one.

## Origin

This started as the `request-logger` exercise from the
[AI Coding Crash Course](https://github.com/ai-hero-dev/ai-coding-crash-course)
by AI Hero, extracted into a standalone, installable tool.
