 * identical requests within seconds. Every one of them is a real POST, so
 * `shouldLogRequest` alone cannot tell it apart from real traffic - this can.
 *
 * A well-behaved agent, and a human retrying by hand, never produce the same
 * method+path+status more than a handful of times in a couple of seconds. A
 * retry loop with no backoff does. Once a signature crosses BURST_THRESHOLD
